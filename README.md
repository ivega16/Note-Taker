# Note-Taker

## Description

My motivation was to create a note taker application so that individuals could keep track of their tasks and responsibilites. I built this project so it could help those in need of a note taker. This problem solves disorganization and improves time management. I learned how to use logic to meet the criteria associated with creating and deleting entries.
